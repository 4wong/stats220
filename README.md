## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in **Bachelor of Science (BSc)** specialising in *Data Science.*
- I am taking ***STATS 220*** because it is a necessary course for me in this degree.
- I am interested in learning about data.

### My favourite foods at the moment are:

1. Pho
2. Sushi
3. Protein Weetbix
